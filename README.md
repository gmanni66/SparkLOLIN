Foot Controller for the Spark Amp using ESP32 LOLIN lite

Thank you to Paul Hamshere, this project lets you connect a foot controller directly to the Spark Amp 
and change preset
This won't work with the App but has lots of potential 

there is a simple OLED that will show you the connection and the Preset Number (only) not the actual name 
but it is simple enough and above all it works :D
